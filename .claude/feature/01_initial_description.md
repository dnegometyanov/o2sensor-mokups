I wanna create an iphone app mockup on github pages.

The app we create mokups for is a client for 02sensor ( fitness/ sleep tracker / health monitor).

The sensor is a bracelet looking like smart watch, but it will show only 2 things:
1) top part - current o2level that changes color to red when < 82%, t yellow when < 90% and green whem >90%
2) bottom part - pulse.
it also may display a small chart near both
it has oled screen, so probably background will be black
It is connected wo app wth bluetooth all the time !
so 1 mockup for the watch lets create as well. Its rectangle with rounded edges, black plastic body.

the app will have the following:

Main screen (tab at the bottom):
1) connection status with bracelet)watch) ( dont take much space - just display watch icon + status connected / disconnected, maybe some color)
2) current 02 and pulse from bracelet - realtime
charts (schematical) with period selection nearby.

Notifications (tab at the bottom):

set alert thresholds for 02sensor and pulse.
thresholds should be set in a nice way - maybe nice scrollbar with 10% step ?
and actions (switches + fields if needed to add email/phone)
 - red screen watch
 - red screen app and critical notification on iphone
 - vibration on watch
 - vibration on phone
 - sound on watch
 - sound on app
 - emails 
 - sms 
 - call
with ability to add phone numbers and emails where needed 

design: liquid glass - do with dark and light versions.
try to emulate realistic look on iphone.
