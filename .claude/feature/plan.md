# O2 Pulse Mockup Plan

## Mockup 1: Watch / Bracelet Device (next up)
**Core idea:** Realistic OLED watch face mockup of the O2 sensor bracelet hardware itself.
- Rectangle with rounded edges, black plastic body, OLED screen (pure black background)
- **Top half:** Current SpO2 level in large digits, color-coded (green >=90%, yellow 82-89%, red <82%), with a tiny sparkline chart showing last ~30 seconds
- **Bottom half:** Pulse BPM with heart icon, animated heartbeat, small sparkline chart
- Watch band straps rendered above and below the device
- Simulated real-time data (same fluctuation engine as Concept A)
- Subtle glow effects on the OLED digits
- Displayed alongside the iPhone mockup on the page, with tabs to switch between views

## Mockup 2: Concept B — Wellness Dashboard (future)
**Core idea:** A more lifestyle/fitness-oriented app design, less clinical.
- Dashboard layout with ring/donut charts for daily O2 and pulse goals
- Activity-style cards (similar to Apple Fitness rings)
- Sleep tracking summary card with overnight SpO2 trend
- More colorful, gradient-heavy aesthetic vs the clinical look of Concept A
- Emphasis on streaks, personal records, wellness scores
- Same notification/alerts screen with a different visual treatment

## Mockup 3: Concept C — Caregiver / Multi-Patient View (future)
**Core idea:** An app designed for caregivers monitoring multiple people wearing O2 sensors.
- Grid/list view showing multiple patients/family members
- Each card shows: name, avatar, current SpO2 + pulse, connection status, last alert
- Tap into a patient → detail view similar to Concept A
- Emergency alert banner for any critical readings across all monitored users
- Quick-action buttons: call, message, view history
- Designed for elderly care, hospital, or family use cases
